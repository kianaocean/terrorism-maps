# terrorism-maps
I performed this data exploration as my contribution to a group project in one of my classes at Carnegie Mellon. The assignment was open ended - we needed to choose a dataset we found interesting and perform some analysis and commentary using R Markdown.

Because the impact of terrorism is so strongly related to the location of the attack and our dataset included latitude/longitude coordinates of each attack, I thought that maps would be an effective way to visually explore the data. I first wanted to get an understanding of patterns of terrorism on a global basis, then zoom in on the United States to visualize patterns of terrorism in our home country.
