# terrorism-maps
I performed this data exploration as my contribution to a group project in one of my classes at Carnegie Mellon. The assignment was open ended - we needed to choose a dataset we found interesting and perform some analysis and commentary using R Markdown.

The primary resource of our study is the Global Terrorism Database, self described as “the most comprehensive unclassified database on terrorist attacks in the world.” The GTD includes data on over 200,000 attacks from 1970 to the present (2019) with up to 135 different attributes for each attack. My group did some preprocessing of the data using tidyverse. It’s this processed data that I use for this analysis.

Because the impact of terrorism is so strongly related to the location of the attack and our dataset included latitude/longitude coordinates of each attack, I thought that maps would be an effective way to visually explore the data. I first wanted to get an understanding of patterns of terrorism on a global basis, then zoom in on the United States to visualize patterns of terrorism in our home country.
